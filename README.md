# php_online_quiz

This is a PHP online quiz website.
It has a timer, and total points that a user score.
The webpage is a responsive web page.
I use a ball state web sever, so only connected devices which has ball state Internet connections can view this webpage.
However, if you have a ball state VPN, you can also view a webpage as well.
